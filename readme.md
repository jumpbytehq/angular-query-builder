Angular Query Builder
======================

**Demo:** http://mfauveau.github.io/angular-query-builder

This is a sample HTML / JavaScript application that demonstrates how to use
Angular.js to create a dynamic query building web UI.

This was inspired by: https://github.com/kindohm/knockout-query-builder

**Update:** The conditions and fields can be passed as attributes to the query-builder directive (check the updated example in index.html).
